1) when you have data thats related but in seperated tables.

2) applies a cartesian product(multiplied together) and Macthes rows that share a common ID/Primary key.                                                                                                                                          

3) outer join would be connecting rows that dont match. also connecting tables by a common field.

4) results in a combination of the two rows called.

5) inner join-O, left and right outer join-hi, cross-join-O

6) used to combine columns that are not unique to create a unique value/primary key. matches multiple attribute from each side.

7)first query includes the rsults that return null since Count(*) is used the second query returns
the number of orderid from sales.custromer

8) the where clause can be causing the Ccustid to be filtered out since the outer join is consiudered unkown
and where filters out unkowns.
