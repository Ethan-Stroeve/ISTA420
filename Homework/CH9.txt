1) temporal tables is a built in feature to define current and historical data for every row in a table
The two period columns which are of datetime2 data type, SysStartTime and SysEndTime define the current 
and historical data for every row of the table. 

2) Temporal tables can be used in audits or anythin

3) the semantics of a temporal table are a primary key, two columns defined as DATETIME2, a start column, an end column, 
designation of the period columns, the table option SYSTEM_versioning, and a linked history table

4) you search a history table by quering it in the same way you would any other table just specifying FOR SYSTEM_TIME

5) To modify the history table you can delete data to have it inserted into history

6)  to delete data from the history table run delete from example where empid = 10, you may delete data from a history
table if you no longer carry a product and the history is no longer relavent or to hide from auditors.

7) To query all data from a current table you just run code normally (select * from etc )but to query a history
table use the FOR SYSTEM_Time and a sub clause that indicates the validity point or period of time you wish to return.
select ... from <table_or_view> for System_Time <subclause> as <alias> 

8) to return all data from history and current you can use the all keyword like so.
SELECT *
FROM   dbo.People FOR SYSTEM_TIME ALL;
