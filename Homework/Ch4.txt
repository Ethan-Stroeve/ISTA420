1) a subquery is a query within a query. It can be self contained or correlated.

2) self conatined does not rely on any tables from other(outer) queries and can run by itself. runs once.

3) a query that relies on tables from a different(outer) query. also can't run by itself. runs once for each row.

4) a scalar subquery returns a single value. can be used to find highest value item store sells
declare @maxprice as INT = (select max(itemprice) from products);
select itemprice, itemtype itemname from products where item price = @maxprice;
declared statement can be substituted in where statement. 

5) a multivalued subquery returns multiple values. can be used to find how many people have the same name
select custorder from orderdetails where custid in (select c.custid from c.customers as c where c.contactname like n&'T%'); 

6) a correlated subquery returns values from differnt table. you would use this when you need to get data from two seperate tables.
selec custid, orderid from sales.orders as 01 where oderid = (select max(02.orderid) from sales.orders as 02 where 02.custid = 01.custid);

7) Exist predicate returns true if the subquery returns any rows and false if it does not.
select custid from sale.customer as c where country = n'argentina' and exists (select * from sales.orders as o where o.custid = c.custid

8) if you use not before a predicate it negates that predicate

9) when using exists or not exists it will return two valuse becasues there there eithier is a row or there is not it would never be unknown

10) to use a subquery to calculate aggregates you would have two values one is your running value(summed) and the second is the current value
select orderyear, qty, (select sum(02.qty) from sales.orderototalbyyear as 02 where 02.orderyear <= 01.orderyear) as
runqty from sales.orderototalbyyear as 01 order by orderyear;
