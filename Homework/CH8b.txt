1) To update a sales tax rate I would do 
update Tax.Detail set Rate += 0.03 where state = Texas

2)select unnitprice, totalprice * taxrate as salestax from orderdetails

3) the proprietary assignment update command works by updating data in a table and assigning values to variables.

4) one important part that MERGE in SQL does is merge data from a source into a target while applying different actions
Etl (extract transform load)is a type of data intergation (moving data to new systems) 

5) semantics of Merge is you specify the target table name in the merge clause and the souce table name in the using clause
you define a merge condition by specifing the predicate in the on clause. you define the action taken when a match is found
in a clause called when macthed then and the action taken when not macthed using not macthed then.

6) insert into dbo.orders
	output inserted.OrderId, inserted.ProductItem
	select ProductName
	from od.orderdetails
	where manufactured = N'USA';

7) Update dbo.Sales
	set price += 10.05
	output
	inserted.productID, inserted.ProductName, deleted.Price as oldprice, inserted.price as new price
	where productid = 10;

8) Delete from dbo.sales
	output
	deleted.SaleId, deleted.saledate, deleted.price, deleted.Empid
	where saledate > '20190312';

9) Merge Into dbo.Employees as E
	using dbo.EmployeeDetail as ED
	on E.empid = ED.empid
	when matched then 
	update set
	e.companyname = ed.companyname
	etc = etc
	when not macthed then
	insert(empid, companyname, etc)
	values (ed.empid, ed.companyname, etc)
	output inserted.empid, deleted.empid etc

10) nested DML lets you directly insert into the final target table only the subset of rows you need from the full set of modified rows.

11) alter table person
	add column DayOfBirth sting 'abcd...'

12) Alter Table
	add Constraint day = mon

13) create table week (
	add constraint day 
	foreign key (year)
	references ValidDay
