1) set operators are operators the combine rows from two query result sets.

2) a set operator must produce results with the same number of columns, must have compatible data types.

3) a venn diagram show the relationship and differnce of two sets by overlaping circles.

4) union operator combines all parts of the two input queries but excludes will filter out duplicatres and
may filter out attributes.

5) union all operator combines all parts of two inputs queries including duplicates.

6) intersect operator keeps the rows that are common to all queries.

7) interssect all operator returns all common rows including common rows that are duplicates.

8) except operator returns the rows in the first query input that are not in the second  query.

9) except all is the same as except but will take into account duplicates and return rows if there is more
in the first query input then the second.

10) the precedence of set operator is intersect followed by union and execpt, union and execpt are evaluted based
order of apperance.

11) to get results from two sets without shared values you would do
(A union B) except (a intersect b) // (a except b) union (b except a)
