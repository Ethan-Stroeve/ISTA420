1) A windows function takes a subset of the rows as input and transforms that input into a scalar value 
for each row in the data set (calculation against set and returns single value)

2) Partition is a process of dividing very large tables into small manageable parts or partitions, 
such that each part has its own name and storage characteristics.

3) order by defines ordering and sorts the result-set (orders the partitions)

4) rows between filters a frame or a subset between two specified delimiters(a value range)

5) ranking window function is used to rank each row with respect to others in the window. 
You would use it to keep track of row numbers and can sort with consideration to the values in each row.

6) offset window function allows you to return data from other rows based on their distance away from the current row.
you would use this if you need multiple results from rows but had to filter out results inbetween.

7) lag and lead does the same as the window function. lag look before the current row and lead looks after.

8) First_value and Last_value is used to return the first and last rows within the window frame.

9) Aggregate Window Functions operate on a set of rows and return a single value for each row from the underlying query

10) pivot table is a set of data that is transformed from a collection of separate rows to a collection of columns.

11) the power set of a set S is the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself. 

 
12) A bit array is a array data structure that compactly stores bits. 
grouping_ID() returns a bitmap

13) chmod 755 would give permissions to myscript.sql the owner would have all rights abd group/others would haave all except write.
